Shakespeare
=====================

Sonnet 5
---------------
Those hours, that with gentle work did frame\nThe lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell,\nWill play the tyrants to the very same\nAnd that unfair which fairly doth excel;\nFor never-resting time leads summer on\nTo hideous winter, and confounds him there;\nSap checked with frost, and lusty leaves quite gone,\nBeauty o'er-snowed and bareness every where:\nThen were not summer's distillation left,\nA liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,\nBeauty's effect with beauty were bereft,\nNor it, nor no remembrance what it was:\nBut flowers distill'd, though they with winter meet,\nLeese but their show; their substance still lives sweet.
