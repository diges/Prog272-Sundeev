Shakespeare
=====================

Sonnet 4
---------------
Unthrifty loveliness, why dost thou spend\nUpon thy self thy beauty's legacy?\nNature's bequest gives nothing, but doth lend,\nAnd being frank she lends to those are free:\nThen, beauteous niggard, why dost thou abuse\nThe bounteous largess given thee to give?\nProfitless usurer, why dost thou use\nSo great a sum of sums, yet canst not live?\nFor having traffic with thy self alone,\nThou of thy self thy sweet self dost deceive:\nThen how when nature calls thee to be gone,\nWhat acceptable audit canst thou leave?\nThy unused beauty must be tombed with thee,\nWhich, used, lives th' executor to be.
