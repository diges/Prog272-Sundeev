Shakespeare
=====================

Sonnet 2
---------------
When forty winters shall besiege thy brow,\nAnd dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,\nThy youth's proud livery so gazed on now,\nWill be a tatter'd weed of small worth held:\nThen being asked, where all thy beauty lies,\nWhere all the treasure of thy lusty days;\nTo say, within thine own deep sunken eyes,\nWere an all-eating shame, and thriftless praise.\nHow much more praise deserv'd thy beauty's use,\nIf thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine\nShall sum my count, and make my old excuse,'\nProving his beauty by succession thine!\nThis were to be new made when thou art old,\nAnd see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold."
